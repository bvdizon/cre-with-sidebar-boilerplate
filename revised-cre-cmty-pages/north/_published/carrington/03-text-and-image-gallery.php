            <p class="par-lg">Located to the north of Stoney Trail and the east of 14 Street West in the North West quadrant of Calgary, Alberta, is a tranquil residential community known as Carrington. </p>
            <p class="par-lg">Inspired by an English name, the Carrington homes for sale depict a fine amalgamation of the traditional English Carriage home styles and contemporary architectural designs to create a neighborhood that is heavily urbanized yet mysteriously archaic. </p>
            <p class="par-lg">Carrington show homes are now open with semi-estate homes from the $700,000s, front drive single-family homes from the mid-$400,000s, and duplexes from the $320,000s. </p>
            <p class="par-lg">The communityâ€™s first phase contains 199 residential lots. </p>
            <p class="par-xl">The Carrington real estate combines a variety of housing styles ranging from front drive garage homes, duplexes to low rise apartments and condominiums. </p>
