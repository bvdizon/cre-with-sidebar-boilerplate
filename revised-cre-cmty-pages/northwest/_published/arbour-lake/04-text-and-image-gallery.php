                sports just minutes
                from your door.</p>
            <p class="par-lg">Located in the northwest quadrant of Calgary, Alberta, this residential neighbourhood is
                proudly
                Northwest Calgary's only lake community.</p>

            <p class="par-lg">With remarkable mountain views, world-class amenities, and an incredible, picture-perfect
                lake, there is
                no shortage of beautiful property in the community of Arbour Lake.</p>
            <p class="par-lg">In addition the single-family homes, Arbour Lake also offers townhomes, condos, and
                beautiful estates,
                making finding your dream home easy.</p>
            <p class="par-lg">Homestyles in Arbour Lake wonderfully reflect the innovative era they were built in. Clean
                lines with
