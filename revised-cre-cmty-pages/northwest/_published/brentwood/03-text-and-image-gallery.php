    <div class="col-grid-2">
        <div>
        <p class="par-lg">Brentwood is located between Crowchild Trail, Shaganappi Trail, Charleswood Drive, and Nose Hill Park, northwest of downtown Calgary. This convenient location places the community between the city's largest park, and the University of Calgary.
</p>
        <p class="par-lg">Light Rail Service also carries passengers to the downtown area and beyond along Crowchild Trail. Adjacent communities include Charleswood, Dalhousie, and Varsity, which includes the Estates, Acres, and Village sub-areas.</p>
        <p class="par-xl">This vintage charm is complemented by the modern condo buildings and re-developed properties, showcasing sleek and simple new-traditional elements.</p>

        <p class="par-lg">Buying one of the spacious homes for sale in Brentwood will likely put you on a quiet, tree-lined street, with a generous yard and convenient back-alley access and storage. The styles that are most common are mid to late-century garrison, bi-level homes, with vinyl siding and bungalow-style roofs.</p>
