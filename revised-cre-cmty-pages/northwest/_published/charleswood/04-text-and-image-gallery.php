        <p class="par-lg">Featuring the mid-century craftsman homebuilding quality, you can still find the desirable original hardwood and plaster walls that so many yearn for today.</p>

        <p class="par-xl">The pride and care that Charlestown residents have is evident across each street and avenue.</p>
        <p class="par-lg">Homes that have already undergone renovations are really stunning. These renovations tend to work themselves from the inside out, so pay special attention to MLSÂ® listing pictures before you make up your mind. You could be missing out on your Calgary dream home otherwise!</p>

        <p class="par-lg">As part of the Triwood Community Assosiciation, Charleswood families get exclusive access to amazing programs for kids, adults, and seniors. Programs include fitness for all ages, summer camps, public events, and exiciting yearly markets. The Triwood Arena hosts a variety of programming that include hockey, ringette, soccer and broomball.</p>
