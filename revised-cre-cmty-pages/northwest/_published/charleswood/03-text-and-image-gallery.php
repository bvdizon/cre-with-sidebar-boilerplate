        <p class="par-lg">Once a satellite community, Charleswood was fully annexed as part of the city of Calgary in 1923. In the late 1950's, a major shift in community development started, resulting in beautiful, single-family homes full of charm and style.
</p>
        <p class="par-xl">As these homes switch hands to younger generations, they are getting beautiful, modern face lifts and upgraded utilities.</p>
        <p class="par-lg">These shifts create a wealth of selection for today's many homebuyers. Whether you are looking for a home to renovate or a move-in ready home, there is an abundance of choice for every style and budget.</p>

        <p class="par-lg">This residential neighbourhood is made up of about 91% single-family homes, of which about 79% are owner-occupied. Condos make up some of the new-construction projects happening in this area, and make up about 5% of the total housing.</p>
