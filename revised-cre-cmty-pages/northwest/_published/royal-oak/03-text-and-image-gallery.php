        <div>
            <p class="par-lg">Overlooking the breathtaking panorama of the Rockies, this tranquil neighborhood has abundant greenery consisting of treed areas, wetlands, and even an environmental reserve.</p>
            <p class="par-lg">From simple townhomes to stylish condos and single family dwellings.</p>
            <p class="par-xl">The Royal Oak homes for sale have become one of the major hot-spots for home buyers, given the area’s elevation above sea level, which allows stunning views of the surrounding downtown and mountain ranges.</p>
            <p class="par-lg">The Royal Oak real estate is well connected by means of a pathway system that meanders through the community and connects it to the city’s major road network.</p>
