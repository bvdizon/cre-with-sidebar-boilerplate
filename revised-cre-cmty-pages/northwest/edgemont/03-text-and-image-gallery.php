        <p class="par-lg">The history of Edgemont Real estate dates back to 1978, with some of the developmental projects getting winded up only recently. A typical Calgary suburb, the community in Edgemont offers a competitive selection of housing options suited to the varied tastes and preferences of its residents.

</p>

        <p class="par-xl">With carefully planned landscape and well established infrastructures, Edgemont homes for sale include estate homes, single family homes, apartments and condominiums. </p>
        
        <p class="par-lg">Edgemont homes for sale have been quite popular throughout the last decade due to varying factors. One such factor is the neighborhoodâ€™s elevated position at 1245 meter above sea level. This allows residents to enjoy splendid views of the Rocky Mountains and also, the southern parts of the city.</p>
        <p class="par-lg">A significant portion of Edgemont real estate is basically an extension of Nose Hill. This is apparent due to the presence of steep escarpment in the south-east.</p>
