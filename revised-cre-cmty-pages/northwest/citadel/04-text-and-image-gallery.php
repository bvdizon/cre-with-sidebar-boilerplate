        <p class="par-lg">Flanked by the Sarcee Trail to the east, Country Hills Blvd to the south and Stoney Trail to the west and north, Citadel is a friendly residential neighborhood located in North West Calgary. One of the very first communities to adopt the Home Owner Association fee, Citadel now boasts of being one of the most idyllic locations in entire Calgary courtesy its lush parks, exquisite flower beds, enchanting tree-lined streets and vintage style brick walls.</p>

        <p class="par-lg">Schools in Citadel include the St. Brigid Catholic School (Elementary and Junior High), the Citadel Park Elementary School, and Arbour Lake School.</p>
