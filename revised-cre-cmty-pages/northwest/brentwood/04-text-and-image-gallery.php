        <p class="par-lg">At Brentwood's western corner, the expansive Northland Village Mall hosts many stores and restaurants. And at the souther end, Brentwood Village rounds out the offerings with banks, pubs, and more stores.</p>
        <p class="par-xl">Residents in Brentwood enjoy a wide selection of family-friendly amenities and services.</p>
        <p class="par-lg">Other highlights in this community are the amenities surrounding the Brentwood Community Association, including an aquatic center, library, and community garden, and the epic Nose Hill Park. Nose Hill Park is one of the largest city parks in North America, consisting of 11 square kilometres of rolling hills, grassy meadows, and scenic tree stands. This is a great spot to visit to take in views of the neighborhood and downtown Calgary.</p>
