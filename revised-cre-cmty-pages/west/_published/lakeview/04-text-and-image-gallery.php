    <div class="col-grid-2">
        <div>
        <p class="par-lg">Lakeview homeowners enjoy a variety of real estate options which are close to parks, green-spaces and transportation corridors. </p>
        <p class="par-lg">These two SW Calgary neighbourhoods enjoy convenient entry to the Glenmore Reservoir & the Weaslehead Flats. </p>
        <p class="par-lg">Many of the luxury homes in Lakeview also have amazing views of the Rocky Mountains. </p>
        <p class="par-lg">Lakeview is bordered by North Glenmore Park from the south, which provides a scenic overlook of the Glenmore Reservoir. </p>
        <p class="par-lg">North Glenmore Park contains pathways and bike trails throughout, which lead all around the reservoir into Weaselhead Flats and down into South Glenmore Park. </p>
        <p class="par-lg">Along with the numerous picnic areas and fire pits, there is also a group of public tennis courts. </p>
        <p class="par-lg">The park is home to Calgary Canoe Club and Calgary Rowing Club, which hosts the annual Calgary Dragon Boat festival in late August, with free admission to the races. </p>
        <p class="par-lg">Earl Grey Golf Club is located in Lakeview and offers both a 9-hole and 18-hole course overlooking Glenmore Reservoir. </p>
        <p class="par-lg">Entertainment is not hard to find, with Chinook Mall being only a short drive away, whether you be in the mood for shopping or an evening movie. </p>
        <p class="par-lg">Heritage Park is also just down the road, for those who wish to take a historical tour from where Calgary began to what it has become. </p>
