        <div>
            <p class="par-lg">Established in 2001, the community has been developed on a land that was originally a part of the Municipal District of Rocky View.</p>
            <p class="par-xl">One of the newer communities in the whole of Calgary! </p>
            <p class="par-lg">West Springs real estate offers a wide range of housing options from detached single-family houses to townhouses, condos, and even palatial luxury estate homes. </p>
            <p class="par-lg">While the high-end residential properties typically open up at an average price of $1 million, the more affordable condos can be yours for around $440,000. </p>
