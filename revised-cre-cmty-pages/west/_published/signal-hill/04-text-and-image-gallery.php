            <p class="par-lg">Originally known as the media village during the 1988 Winter Olympics, the community in Signal Hill was redeveloped with a variety of residential dwellings including single family detached homes and condominiums to fulfill the varying needs of the homebuyers and investors alike. </p>
            <p class="par-xl">With its close proximity to a host of recreational venues and public amenities and stunning views of the city, the Signal Hill real estate forms an ideal neighborhood for both young families as well as the retirees. </p>
            <p class="par-lg">Despite the popularity of the neighborhood, home prices are quite affordable with a majority of the housing units available at a little over the Calgary average.</p>
