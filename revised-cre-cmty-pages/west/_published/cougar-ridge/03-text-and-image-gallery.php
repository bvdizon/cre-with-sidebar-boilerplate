            <p class="par-lg">Located within close proximity of the Canada Olympic Park on the western side of Calgary, Cougar Ridge is a newly developed community that offers its residents a variety of housing options set against the backdrop of a picturesque landscaping and well structured network of pathways that connect the community to the nearby city locations and wetland.</p>
            <p class="par-lg">Given the fact that the community in Cougar Ridge is perched atop a ridge, it offers some of the most breathtaking views of the panoramic skyline of the downtown Calgary and the brilliant natural architecture of the surrounding Rocky Mountains.</p>
