            <p class="par-lg">With a major chunk of its development happening in the 50s and the 60s, Westgate homes for sale primarily comprise of vintage style bungalows on wide lots and two story traditional housing units.</p>
            <p class="par-lg">Alternatively, there are a couple of townhomes and condominiums also available in the community in Westgate.</p>
            <p class="par-lg">Given the fact that most of the dwellings are more than half a century old, a majority of them have undergone a series of upgrades and remodels to achieve the contemporary style suited to the modern homebuyers and investors.</p>
            <p class="par-lg">While a typical two-storey housing unit will be listed around $600,000, the condos are a more affordable option at an average price of $250,000+.</p>
