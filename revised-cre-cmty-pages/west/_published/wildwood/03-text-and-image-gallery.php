        <div>
        <p class="par-lg">Originally developed as an upscale community full of single detached bungalows constructed on wide lots and coupled with rear laneways, the Wildwood real estate also features a couple of low-rise apartments and condominiums for the practical home buyer looking for an affordable property. </p>
        <p class="par-lg">Although located only a few kilometers west of the Downtown core, the charming community in <span class="par-xl">Wildwood reminds you of the tranquil countryside far away from the maddening bustle of the concrete jungle</span>. </p>
        <p class="par-lg">The luxurious housing units in Wildwood are typically listed at an average price of just under $1M. </p>
