            <p class="par-lg">While the community in Glamorgan comprises around 1200 single family detached homes, there are approximately 1100 units of townhouses and condos in the neighborhood. </p>
            <p class="par-lg">You will be able to find your dream home in the neighborhood for an affordable $200,000 to a hefty $1 million as well. </p>
            <p class="par-lg">Since most of the residential properties were initially built in the 50s, a majority of them have undergone a myriad of upgrades and remodels in the last decade.</p>
