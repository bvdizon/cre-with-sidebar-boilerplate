            <p class="par-xl">For those looking for long-term serious investment, Eagle Ridge real estate is a great
                option. </p>
            <p class="par-lg">Close proximity to the Glenmore Reservoir and Heritage Park, and a variety of community
                center
                activities, all add up to a vibrant neighborhood that has something for everyone. </p>
            <p class="par-lg">Although large single-family residences form the majority of homes for sale at Eagle Ridge
                real estate,
                condos and attached homes are also available.</p>
            <p class="par-lg">Easy access to all amenities including schools, shopping centers, extensive transport and
                scenic locales
                make this community a highly desirable one.</p>
