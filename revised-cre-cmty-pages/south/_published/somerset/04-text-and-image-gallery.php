    <div class="col-grid-2">
        <div>
            <p class="par-lg">The Somerset-Bridlewood Community Association administers Somerset, with the Resident’s
                Association maintaining a Water Park, Volleyball court and Tennis Courts. </p>
            <p class="par-xl">In nearby Shawnessy is a shopping centre, with retail stores, restaurants and pubs/clubs.
            </p>
            <p class="par-lg">Quick fast food restaurants are easy to come across, but the area also has more fine
                dining restaurants as well, including Moxies, Plaka Greek Restaurant and Hong Kong Garden. Hudson’s Bar
                and Grill is a pub and club and is a popular nightlife destination.</p>
            <p class="par-lg">If not up for a night on the town, Empire Theatres operates a theatre showing the newest
                releases. Well known shops are also in the area, from Winners to Sports Check, and even big box stores,
                such as Walmart and Canadian Tire.</p>
            <p class="par-lg">The CBE operates an elementary school in Somerset, with a highschool nearby. Bishop
                O’Byrne High School is a special case, as it is a high school, YMCA and public library built in one. A
                private Christian charter school is also located in Somerset.</p>
