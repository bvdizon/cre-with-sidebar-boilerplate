            <p class="par-lg">>Fish Creek Provincial Park is located in the north of the community and is an example of
                an urban setting
                being able to be ecologically friendly. </p>
            <p class="par-lg">Fish Creek is perfect for jogging, walking, picnics and fires. </p>
            <p class="par-xl">Full of wildlife and plant life, Fish Creek is a popular destination for those wishing to
                escape the urban city and escape into a garden paradise. </p>
            <p class="par-lg">Nearby Shawnessy has a shopping district, complete with restaurants, boutiques, and a
                cinema. </p>
            <p class="par-lg">The YMCA also has a facility in Bishop Oâ€™Byrne in Somerset, meeting all fitness needs with
                a weight room, a gym, and a swimming pool.</p>
            <p class="par-lg">Evergreen recently had a public elementary school opened, from K-4.</p>
