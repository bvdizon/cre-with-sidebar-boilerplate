    "description": "Sundance is part of the Mid-Sun Community Association (short for Midnapore-Sundance), which has a community hall complete with a gym, standard kitchen, a lounge and meeting rooms. The association offers sports programs, fitness programs, dance classes, senior programs and childcare. In the heart of the community is Lake Sundance, access available for all residents, who can bring friends and family for a lovely day in the sand and water, or take advantage of using the playground, tennis courts or the green grass. Bordering the community from the east is Fish Creek Provincial Park, a beautiful, scenic park full of lush vegetation and wildlife. Excellent for hiking, jogging and biking/rollerblading, Fish Creek is a popular destination to escape the urban areas and find peace. Fish Creek is also home to the public Sicome Lake, where people are free to play and swim. Watch the video to learn more.",
