            Established in 1957, Kingsland is a residential community nestled within the south-west quadrant of Calgary
            in Alberta.
            The bungalows built in the early fifties have undergone multiple renovations to upgrade them according to
            the needs and expectations of the contemporary home buyer and real estate investors.
            Homes for sale in Kingsland are readily available within a price range from the mid 300s to as high as 900s.
