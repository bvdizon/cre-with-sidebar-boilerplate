            <p class="par-lg">Bordered by the famous Inglewood Golf Course to the west, Dover is a pleasant residential neighborhood located in the south-east quadrant of Calgary. </p>
            <p class="par-xl">Despite the fact that it is one of the oldest communities in this part of the city, Dover Real Estate has managed to retain its old-world charm and traditional traits, glimpses of which can be easily seen in its original landscape and architecture.</p>
