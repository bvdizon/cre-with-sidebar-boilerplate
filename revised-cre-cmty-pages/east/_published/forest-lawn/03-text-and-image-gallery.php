        <div>
            <p class="par-lg">A former town located in the south-east quadrant of Calgary, Forest Lawn is now a flourishing and one of the most desirable residential communities in the city. </p>
            <p class="par-lg">The neighborhood is surrounded by 48 Street SE on the east, 8 Avenue SE on the north and the 36 Street SE on the west and the 26 Avenue SE on the south.</p>
            <p class="par-lg">Originally incorporated as the Town of the Forest Lawn, the community in Forest Lawn still retains its archaic charm in its architectural styles and landscape. </p>
            <p class="par-lg">A typical suburb of Calgary, Forest Lawn Real Estate is a historic neighborhood that offers a variety of housing options from townhomes to apartment condos that are regularly listed at an average price of $330,000. </p>
            <p class="par-lg">Given the fact that most of the residential properties date back nearly a century ago, the homes for sale in Forest lawns have undergone a series of renovations to keep them in sync with the changing demands of the contemporary homebuyer.</p>
