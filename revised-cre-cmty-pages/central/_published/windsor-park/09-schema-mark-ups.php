    "description": "The Windsor Park Community Association administers the community and has a community center, complete with a standard kitchen, meeting rooms, and stage. The association also maintains an outdoor skating rink and sports/playing field and hosts yoga, dance, and senior programs. Chinook Centre mall is located south-east of the community and is Calgary’s largest enclosed shopping center, with over 250 stores, a football field-sized food court, and a major theatre complex. With the closure of two major anchors, Zellers and Sears, Target and Nordstrom will respectively replace each as the new anchors. Windsor Park is home to the Calgary Golf and Country Club, an 18-hole golf course established in 1897, making it Alberta’s oldest private golf and country club.  The CBE operates a public elementary school, with a child development center also located in the community. ",
