            <p class="par-lg">Sharing its southern border with the Trans-Canada Highway, the Capitol Hill is a beautiful
                residential neighborhood in the North West quadrant of Calgary. </p>
            <p class="par-xl">A quaint neighborhood, Capitol Hill is highly desirable among the young couples, growing
                families and retirees alike.</p>
            <p class="par-lg">Despite the fact that the community in Capitol Hill was established in the late forties,
                you will be able to spot a few old world buildings that have been there since 1910! </p>
            <p class="par-lg">Since the Capitol Hill Real Estate is located within the immediate vicinity of the
                University of Calgary and the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology, a majority of the residents
                comprise young students and teachers. </p>
            <p class="par-lg">Homes for sale in Capitol Hill include single family detached units and bungalows as well
                as apartment condominiums that are available at an average price of $690,000. </p>
            <p class="par-lg">With the famous Confederation park bordering the community on the north, the residents
                enjoy abundant recreational opportunities including running trails and tennis courts.</p>
