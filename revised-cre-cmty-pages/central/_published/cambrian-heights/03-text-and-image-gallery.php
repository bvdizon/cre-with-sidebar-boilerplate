            <p class="par-lg">Nestled within a tranquil neighborhood immediately south-east of the Nose Hill Park, is
                the well developed residential community called Cambrian Heights. </p>
            <p class="par-lg">Although annexed to the city of Calgary in 1910, the actual residential development of the
                neighborhood began only in the late fifties.</p>
            <p class="par-lg">Given its rolling topography and breathtaking landscape, the community in Cambrian Heights
                is one of the most beautiful and highly sought after neighborhoods in the entire city. </p>
            <p class="par-xl">Recreational spaces abound in the area given the communityâ€™s close proximity to both the
                Confederation Park and the Nose Hill Park. </p>
            <p class="par-lg">Homes for sale in Cambrian Heights primarily include single-family detached and attached
                dwellings that are available for purchase at an average price of around $850,000.</p>
