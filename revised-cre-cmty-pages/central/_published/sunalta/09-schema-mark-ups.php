The Poplar trees which line the neighborhood stand as a silent tribute to the heritage of Sunalta, making the surroundings peaceful, beautiful and very friendly. Sunalta is bordered by the Bow River in the North, the Shaganappi golf course on the East, 17 Avenue to the South and 14 Street on the East, making Sunalta one of the most accessible and best connected neighborhoods in Calgary.
