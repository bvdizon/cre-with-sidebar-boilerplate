            <p class="par-lg">If the idea of living in a small but cozy neighborhood excites you, then the Cliff
                Bungalow neighborhood is the ideal location for you to settle down. </p>
            <p class="par-xl">Established as an inner city residential neighborhood in South West Calgary, Cliff
                Bungalow is a well knit community where you can actually get to know your neighbors well.</p>
            <p class="par-lg">Cliff Bungalow has a mixture of older homes and low-rise apartments. </p>
            <p class="par-lg">The homes include bungalow styles and two storey homes. 91.5% of the residences in the
                area were apartments and condominiums, with 72.2% of the housing being used for rental purposes.</p>
