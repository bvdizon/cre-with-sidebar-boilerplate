        <h3>Three General Flavours of Calgary NW Neighborhoods</h3>
        <p>Neighbourhoods in Northwest Calgary come in three general flavours, corresponding roughly to their distance from the downtown area.</p>
        <ol>

Here you'll see straight streets lined with mature trees. Residents also enjoy the proximity to downtown and views of the river valley.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 2rem;"><strong>Moving further from downtown Calgary</strong>, more typical mid-century suburbs begin to make an appearance. Expect to find classic, spacious family homes from the 70s through to the 90s, many in garrison configurations, with vinyl siding over brick bi-levels.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">And, at the <strong>outer boundaries of Northwest Calgary</strong>, home buyers have their pick of new developments, complete with modern features and convenient amenities, including schools, clubhouses, and numerous pocket parks.</li>
