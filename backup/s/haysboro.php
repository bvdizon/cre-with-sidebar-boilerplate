<h2 id="more">Haysboro Real Estate</h2>
<p>Plant your roots in a Haysboro home. Quoted as the neighborhood where no one leaves, Haysboro is an inner-city
    Calgary subdivision in Southwest Calgary. Quaint little bungalows, mature trees lining the&nbsp; streets and a small
    town charm. It&rsquo;s not difficult to speculate on the reason Haysboro homes don&rsquo;t often come up for
    sale.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Things to do in and around Haysboro</h2>
<p>The Haysboro Community Association is very active in the community and has a community hall complete with wheelchair
    access, a standard kitchen, lounge, game room, meeting rooms and sound system. The association works closely with
    the City of Calgary to operate outdoor tennis courts, an outdoor skating rink/hockey rink. The association also
    offers fitness, dance, youth justice and seniors programs.</p>
<p>Haysboro has no shortage of activities, from shopping to outdoor recreation to even a travel back in time to
    Calgary&rsquo;s roots. Two of Calgary&rsquo;s major shopping centres are located a short drive to both the north and
    south, Chinook Centre and Southcentre Mall respectively; each mall is home to 200 &ndash; 250 stores, ranging from
    clothes to toys to home decor. Haysboro is within walking distance of South Glenmore Park along the Glenmore
    Reservoir and is a popular destination for hiking, jogging and biking/rollerblading; the park is guaranteed to
    provide amazing sights year round. Also overlooking Glenmore Reservoir is Heritage Park Historical Village, a
    recreation of the architecture in Calgary between the 1880&rsquo;s up to the 1950&rsquo;s. The park has authentic
    buildings from around Alberta dating to each era, fully restored in order to present visitors with a full history of
    not just Calgary, but the entire province.</p>
<p>Haysboro is home to two public elementary schools and a junior high, as well as several Catholic and private schools.
