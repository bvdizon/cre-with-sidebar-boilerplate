<h2 id="more">Chinatown</h2>
<p>Flanking the Center Street in the north eastern part of the Calgary Downtown, the Chinatown is a rich cultural hub
    that offers a multi-ethnic community complete with modern conveniences for both first time home buyers and
    investors.</p>
<h2>Chinatown Real Estate</h2>
<p>With a history spanning more than a century, the community in Chinatown still preserves its cultural heritage and is
    home to some of the finest examples of the Asian architecture. Among other focal points of the Chinatown Real Estate
    that distinguish it from the other communities in the city are the Chinese Cultural Center and the Dragon City Mall
    that are quite famous in this part of the world. Chinatown is a great place to purchase single family attached units
    or apartment condominiums that are available at an average price of $480,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A multi-ethnic centre in Calgary, Chinatown and its surrounding parts attract a number of Asian businesses as well.
    The heavily Asian-influenced storefronts, restaurants, shops make this a very distinctive community to reside in.
    Specialty food shops, in particular, and shops where quintessential Asian wares and items can be found, make this
    location the primary stop for those who have these needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that China town has served as the social centre point for the East Asian community in
    these parts. Intermixing of cultures from every part of the Asian world allows Chinatown residents to stay inclusive
    without giving up the rich heritage of their past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Highly adaptable as a community, Chinatown shows its mettle in many ways. For example, the tweaking of traditional
    Chinese recipes to match the Calgary lifestyle and tastes has resulted in unique fusion foods emerging in their
    quadrant of Calgary.</p>
<h2>Things to Do in Chinatown</h2>
<p>When it comes to Chinatown, the location is most well-known for its traditional Chinese food and beverage options.
    Explore the bubble tea shops here and learn why this beverage has become quite so popular world over. The Try Again
    Beverages House is one of the must-go places in Chinatown for this purpose. With its amazing selection of unique
    flavours to choose from, you will have a gala time here exploring this new taste. This was one of the first bubble
    tea shops to come up in Calgary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some unique Chinese dishes await you here as well. Silver Inn, where the very famous ginger beef is supposed to have
    first been introduced, is located right here in Centre street. Another great place for authentic Chinese is the
    Silver Dragon, which happens to be one of the oldest restaurants in Chinatown. Quite a few celebs visit this
    restaurant mainly for its Hong Kong-style dim sum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A rocking experience awaits you at Chinatown on Canada Day, when the whole community comes alive. They even shut down
    a part of the Riverfront Avenue so that food trucks can be set up there to cater to the people thronging the
    streets. This is a great time for you to experience authentic Asian fare as well as typical Albertan food well
    within budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget the annual summer festival that comes about every August. With visitors numbering in the tens of
    thousands dropping in here during this time, Chinatown presents a festive atmosphere. The celebrations are divided
    into six zones, each with its own food, shopping and entertainment in line with the overall theme. This is a great
    time to enjoy and experience the Chinese culture in a fun way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dragon City Mall is a hotspot for locals who head out here when they need to get all of their chores done at one
    place. The mall has a good number of stores spread across three spacious levels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the culture lovers, the Chinese Cultural Centre is a good spot to head to. The traditional architecture is the
    first thing that grabs attention, but this centre has much more to offer too. There are martial arts courses,
    Chinese cultural dance lessons and language classes for those who wish to learn Chinese or Mandarin. The Cultural
    Centre Chinese Learning Academy is located here too. Overall, this is a place where you can learn all about Chinese
    culture and heritage!</p>
