<h2 id="more">Bankview</h2>
<p>Located to the west of the densely populated district of Beltline in the inner city, Bankview is a beautiful
    residential neighborhood in South West Calgary. First established as a community in 1908, Bankview underwent a major
    redesign during the early fifties giving rise to the development of several high-density apartment buildings in the
    area.</p>
<h2>Bankview Real Estate</h2>
<p>A master-planned neighborhood, the community in Bankview is surrounded by a breathtaking landscape that offers
    panoramic views of the Rockies. Being one of the oldest communities in the entire city, the Bankview Real Estate
    offers a plethora of housing options ranging from vintage bungalows to high-density apartments and newly developed
    condominiums. Homes for sale in Bankview are regularly listed at an average price of around $670,000, with the
    available residential properties being as cheap as $195,000 and as pricey as $970,000. Recreational opportunities
    abound in the area with numerous parks and playgrounds dotting the entire neighborhood. Also, given its prime
    location, Bankview is just minutes away from the city center as well as a number of shopping complexes.</p>
<h2>Bankview Homes</h2>
<p>Established in the 1880&rsquo;s by William Nimmons for ranching and farming, the housing shortage and economic boom
    during the early 1900&rsquo;s is how Bankview became a part of Calgary, being fully purchased in 1908. After a major
    redesign in the 1950&rsquo;s, Bankview is now a higher density apartment area.</p>
