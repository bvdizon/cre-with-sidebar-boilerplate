<h2 id="more">Downtown West End</h2>
<p>Located within the western region of Downtown Calgary, the Downtown West End is an urban residential neighborhood
    surrounded by the Bow River on the north, the 9th Street W on the east, the 14th Street W on the west and the CPR
    tracks on the south.</p>
<h2>Downtown West End Real Estate</h2>
<p>Once the Canadian Pacific Railway arrived in the area in 1883, the establishment of the community in Downtown West
    End was started in full swing. One of the most sought after locations in the entire city, the Downtown West End Real
    Estate majorly comprises apartment buildings and condominiums, with only around 25 single-family detached homes
    still remaining within the community. From paved multi-use pathways to the Mewata Armouries and the Shaw Millennium
    Park, there is a whole lot of entertainment in store for the potential homeowners in the area. Homes for sale in
    Downtown West End are readily available from $300,000 up to $1.25 million for a single unit.</p>
