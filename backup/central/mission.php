<h2 id="more">Mission Homes</h2>
<p>Originally established as a French Catholic Mission, Mission homes sit in the &nbsp;entertainment centre of Calgary.

<h2>Things to do in and around Mission</h2>
<p>Running right down the middle of Mission is 4th Street, home to a selection of restaurants, shopping and public
    services. Mission has become a popular area for restaurants, with over 35 on 4th street alone and a majority having
    patio space for summer use. Unique restaurants range from the more gourmet foods, such as Mercato International
    restaurant and market offering the best quality Italian food, to the more quick bites from 4th Street Pizza to

<h2>More about the Homes and Condos in Mission</h2>
<p>The river pathways that run right along the eastern boundary of Mission from north to south are some of the most
    scenic trails in Calgary- loved by trekkers and joggers alike. The easy access to these pathway systems makes
    Mission a popular spot for those keen on fitness too. It just takes five minutes to get to this pathway network from
    anywhere in Mission.</p>
<p>Five minutes is all it takes to reach 4th street as well, with its Calgary&rsquo;s-best restaurants, shops and
    amenities. You will find a number of boutique shops here that offer you some of the best shopping that you will find
    in these parts.</p>
<p>This is also the venue of the Calgary Lilac Festival, the annual event that draws over 120,000 people. Hundreds of
    street vendors, local musical talents and more greet you at this festival.</p>
<h2>About Mission</h2>
<p>Do not let the historical significance of Mission fool you into thinking that urbanites do not prefer this location.
    Nothing can be further from the truth! The buzzing hive of activity that Mission is, thanks to 4th street, ensures
    that those who wish to enjoy the excitement and thrill of living in the heart of the city but without its many
    inconveniences choose Mission as their ideal location to set up home.</p>
<p>The immense walkability is another attractive feature of the neighbourhood. The river pathway system notwithstanding,
    the neighbourhood plan itself has been created in such a fashion that the residents can take a brisk walk down to
    any of the amenities. The traffic is efficiently regulated here, leaving the streets perfectly safe for pedestrians.
    With everything within easy reach within the neighbourhood, there is no need to head out far either. Most residents
    prefer to use the car just for commuting to work, carrying out all other activities on foot.</p>
<p>The climate is yet another reason why people prefer these parts of Calgary to such an extent. Warm winds make winters
    bearable, and since these parts get more days of sunshine per year than any other in Canada, the appeal is higher.
</p>
<p>The location has made this area such a property hotspot that new developments are a constant here. Many builders are
    already working on projects or are planning condos here with all the modern amenities, thus giving you a range of
    housing options to pick from.</p>
<p>Mission offers easy access to several recreational facilities. For instance, the Talisman Centre and Stampede Grounds
    both lie close by. Quite a few parks are easy to reach from here- Sandy Beach Park, Stanley Park, Altadore Park are
    just a few. The green lungs surrounding this area are a big reason why people who care about their health and the
    environment choose Mission as their dwelling place.</p>
<p>Since this was originally a Francophone settlement, traces of the culture still remain here in the lifestyle, the
    architecture and the cultural fabric, and this adds a very distinctive character to this location.</p>
<p>With quite a few schooling options easily accessible from here, parents of young children understandably prefer
    Mission to set up home. Some of the local schools are St. Mary&rsquo;s Senior High School, Western Canada Senior
    High School and St. Monica Elementary &amp; Junior High School.</p>
<p>Well-connected by public transportation, Mission is a place from where you can get to other parts of Calgary without
    having to take out the car and drive yourself down.</p>
<h2>Things to Do in Mission</h2>
<p>The 4th street, with its many shops and restaurants, is the most happening area in Mission, and also where residents
    head to on weekends.</p>
<p>Of the many attractions near Mission, you will find that St. Patrick&rsquo;s Island, East Village and Victoria Park
    are great getaways for families and couples too. The Calgary Zoo is an amazing spot for parents with young kids to
    spend the weekend.</p>
<p>Get a taste of authentic Alberta food at East Village for here you will find quite a few food trucks. A simple way to
    get generous helpings at an affordable price, this understandably gets the crowds. Another good place for foodies is
    the SW Business Revitalization Zone on 4th street where an impressive 30-restaurant line-up acquaints you with
    flavours from across the world.</p>
