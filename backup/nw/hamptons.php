<h2>ABOUT</h2>
<h3>The Hamptons &mdash; Making History</h3>
<p>While The Hamptons was officially established as a residential community in 1990, the neighbourhood has a history dating back to the mid-1970s. The southern section of The Hamptons was first annexed in 1976, but the northern section located north of Edgemont was not annexed until 1989.</p>
<h4>Nowadays, the Hamptons is known for its stunning real estate options, as well as its world-famous annual Stampede breakfast and Olympic-sized hockey rink.</h4>
<p>The Hamptons experienced its first residential development in the early 2000s, and the majority of the lavish real estate in The Hamptons today was built after 2005.</p>
