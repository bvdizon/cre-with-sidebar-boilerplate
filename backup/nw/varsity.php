<h2 id="more">Varsity</h2>
<p>Developed in the late 60s, Varsity is one of the most desirable residential neighborhoods in the North West quadrant of Calgary. Perched atop a plateau on the north of the Bow River Valley, the neighborhood comprises of three major areas namely the Varsity Estates, Varsity Village and Varsity Acres.</p>
<h2>Varsity real estate</h2>
<p>The community in Varsity is primarily notable for its single detached dwellings that make for a chunk of all residential properties in the area. While the Varsity Acres and Varsity Village have been developed with a similar street pattern of rear lanes, folded grids, and cul de sacs, the Varsity Estates can be rightly touted as the most upscale of the three with wide detached lots sans any rear lanes. With its close proximity to the Silver Springs Golf Course, local schools, immaculate parks and downtown Calgary, the Varsity Real Estate forms an ideal location for young couples, growing families, and even retirees. While you can find stylish apartments starting around $250,000, the price for the high-end detached homes can go as high as $1 million+.</p>
