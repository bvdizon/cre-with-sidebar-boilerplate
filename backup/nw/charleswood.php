<h2>HOMES</h2>
<h3>Charleswood &mdash; Uncover Homes For Sale</h3>
<p>Once a satellite community, Charleswood was fully annexed as part of the city of Calgary in 1923. In the late 1950's, a major shift in community development started, resulting in beautiful, single-family homes full of charm and style.</p>
<h4>As these homes switch hands to younger generations, they are getting beautiful, modern face lifts and upgraded utilities.</h4>
<p>These shifts create a wealth of selection for today's many homebuyers. Whether you are looking for a home to renovate or a move-in ready home, there is an abundance of choice for every style and budget.</p>
<p>This residential neighbourhood is made up of about 91% single-family homes, of which about 79% are owner-occupied. Condos make up some of the new-construction projects happening in this area, and make up about 5% of the total housing.</p>

<h2>ABOUT CHARLESWOOD REAL ESTATE</h2>
<h3>Charlestown Style</h3>
<h4>Charlestown construction is solid.</h4>
<p>Featuring the mid-century craftsman homebuilding quality, you can still find the desirable original hardwood and plaster walls that so many yearn for today.</p>
<h4>The pride and care that Charlestown residents have is evident across each street and avenue.</h4>
<p>Homes that have already undergone renovations are really stunning. These renovations tend to work themselves from the inside out, so pay special attention to MLS&reg; listing pictures before you make up your mind. You could be missing out on your Calgary dream home otherwise!</p>
