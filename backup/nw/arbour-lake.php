                <h2>ABOUT ARBOUR LAKE REAL ESTATE</h2>
                <h3>Arbour Lake &mdash; Making History</h3>
                <h4>In 1991, the very first Arbour Lake show-home opened it's doors, wowing homebuyers right from the
                    very start. By 1993, the lake was ready for residents to enjoy water activities for the first time
                    ever in the Northwest of Calgary!</h4>
                <p>Starting as only a vision, this beautifully planned community was conceived by David Poppitt, a
                    developer with Melcor Developments. After visiting several upscale, lifestyle-oriented
                    neighbourhoods in Southern California, David knew he had to bring this lifestyle to the people of
                    Calgary.</p>
