<h2 id="more">Carrington</h2>
<p>Located to the north of Stoney Trail and the east of 14 Street West in the North West quadrant of Calgary, Alberta, is a tranquil residential community known as Carrington. One of the recently developed communities, Carrington also boasts of being one of the largest master-planned neighborhoods in the whole of Calgary.</p>
<h2>Carrington Real Estate</h2>
<p>The community in Carrington is the first ever development to be approved by the City&rsquo;s New Municipal Development Plan that highlights a host of sustainability objectives. Inspired by an English name, the Carrington homes for sale depict a fine amalgamation of the traditional English Carriage home styles and contemporary architectural designs to create a neighborhood that is heavily urbanized yet mysteriously archaic. Carrington show homes are now open with semi-estate homes from the $700,000s, front drive single-family homes from the mid-$400,000s, and duplexes from the $320,000s. The community&rsquo;s first phase contains 199 residential lots. The Carrington real estate combines a variety of housing styles ranging from front drive garage homes, duplexes to low rise apartments and condominiums. With some idyllic views of the city and plenty of green spaces such as parks and nature reserves, Carrington is fast becoming one of the most desired neighborhoods in NW Calgary.</p>
